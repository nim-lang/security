# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Securiy advisories are published at:
https://github.com/nim-lang/security/security/advisories?state=published

Security fixes are provided in new releases and in bugfix releases.

We do not backport security fixes to older releases.

(Yet, Linux distributions might backport security fixes for their packages.)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have discovered a vulnerability, please notify us about it via
security@nim-lang.org in order to set up a meeting where we can discuss the next
steps.

Please do not report vulnerabilities via GitHub issues.
